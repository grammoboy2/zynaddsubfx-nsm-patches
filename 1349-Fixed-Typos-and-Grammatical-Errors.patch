 "LFO" means Low Frequency Oscillator.

+These oscillators are not used to make sounds by themselves, but they change
 some parameters (like the frequencies, the amplitudes or the filters).
 
 The LFOs have some basic parameters:

-* *Start Phase*: The position that a LFO will start at

 Other parameters are:
 
-* *Continuous mode*: If this mode is used, the LFO will not start from "zero" on each new note, but it will be continuous. This is very useful if you apply on filters to make interesting sweeps.

 note's frequency.
 It can vary from negative stretch (the LFO frequency is decreased on higher
