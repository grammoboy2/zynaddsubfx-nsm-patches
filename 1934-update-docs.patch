+Sympathetic
+~~~~~~~~
+
+Introduction
+^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+The Sympathetic aims to 'simulate' the sympathetic resonance in a piano.
+That is the effect, that all other strings on a piano are also oscillating
+when one string is played. With high Q setting it's more like playing with sustain pedal.
+
+TIP: map the sustain pedal to the Q parameter
+
+Function
+^^^^^^^^
+
+It is made off a bank of combfilters that are by default tuned like the 
+strings of a piano.
+
+Description
+^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+** *Drive* how much input signal id fed to the strings
+** *Level* Output Volume
+** *Str* Number of strings to use. 12 is a full Octave. On small systems 
+be carefull with cpu load
+** *Q* How strong is the Reflection
+** *Uni* Unisono - how many strings should have the 'same' frequency it' used with the
+next paremeter.
+** *Detune* Amount of detune between the unisono strings
+** *Base* midi note of the lowest string

 ********************************************************************
 
+A special class of filter is the COMB Filter. It creates a spectrum with regular 
+spaced notches like a comb. It can 'simulate' the effect of the reflections
+of a surface next to a microphone using the type FWD. Or it can 'simulate' reflections
+that are created at the end of a string using type BWD or BOTH together.
+In the BWD setting with high Q setting the comb filter can self oscillate.
+Excited with a transient noise it can produce string like sounds.
+
+TIP: When using it in a voice make sure the Envelope doesn't sustain at 0 to prevent 
+the voice being killed while the filter is still making nice sounds.
