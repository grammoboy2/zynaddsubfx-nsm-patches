+
+Requirements:
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+- FFTW 3.x.x  - necessary for Fast Fourier computations
+- MXML-2.5+ from www.minixml.org
+- zlib library from http://www.zlib.org
+- Jack Audio (may be optional in the future)
+
+Optional:
+~~~~~~~~~
+- FLTK 1.x.x (tested with fltk 1.3+)
+- a VST host for the VST version [For more information see:
+  http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=268277&sid=95be0b6c9909300d566006428bcbb97d]
+
+Compilation:
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+  For the main program see doc/build.txt.
+  To compile the Spliter, run "make" from the "Spliter" directory.
+  To compile the Controller, run "make" from the "Controller" directory.
+
+Running on Linux
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Under linux there are several options for both audio output and MIDI input.
+Defaults are set at compile time and the desired backend can be set when
+starting ZynAddSubFX with the '-I' and '-O' options.
+The currently supported backends are:
+
+- Audio Output
+    * ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
+    * OSS (Open Sound System)
+    * JACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit)
+    * Port Audio
+
+- MIDI Input
+    * ALSA
+    * OSS
+    * JACK
+
+Running on OSX
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Under OSX simply download the binary available on http://sourceforge.net/projects/zynaddsubfx
+and run with JACK
+
+Running on Windows
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+NOTE: At this time only older versions of ZynAddSubFX were compiled on windows
+      See older versions on sf.net (ie version 2.2.1)
+
+Have fun! :-)

-Requirements:
--------------
-- a fast computer
-- Linux or Windows
-- FFTW 3.x.x  - necessary for Fast Fourier computations
-- MXML-2.5 or more recent library from www.minixml.org
-- zlib library from http://www.zlib.org
-- (for Linux) OpenSoundSystem (OSS) (if you don't have ALSA, only)
-- (for Windows) pthreads, portaudio
-
-Not required, but recommended:
-------------------------------
-- FLTK 1.x.x (tested with fltk 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2,etc.)
-- ALSA 0.9.x or later (with OSS emulation, if you don't use JACK)
-- JACK
-- a VST host for the VST version [For more information see:

-------------
-    For the main program see doc/build.txt.
-    To compile the Spliter, run "make" from the "Spliter" directory.
-    To compile the Controller, run "make" from the "Controller" directory.

-Running on LINUX
-----------------
-Under linux there are several options for both audio output and MIDI input.
-Defaults are set at compile time and the desired backend can be set when starting ZynAddSubFX with the '-I' and '-O' options.
-The currently supported backends are:
-
-- Audio Output
-    * ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
-    * OSS (Open Sound System)
-    * JACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit)
-    * Port Audio
-
-- MIDI Input
-    * ALSA
-    * OSS
-    * JACK
-
-Running on WINDOWS
-------------------
-NOTE: At this time only older versions of ZynAddSubFX were compiled on windows
-      See older versions on sf.net (ie version 2.2.1)
-    If you launch zynaddsubfx.exe and nothing happens, you need pthreadGC.dll  in the same directory (or windows directory). The dll files are distribuited with ZynAddSubFX windows binaries.
-    It might be possible that the latency will be very high. If this happens, you have to set the environment variable PA_MIN_LATENCY_MSEC to a value that represents the latency in miliseconds.
-    Eg: (in autoexec.bat or launched before running ZynAddSubFX) "set PA_MIN_LATENCY_MSEC=50"
-    Warning: if the value is too low, you might encounter severe dropouts on ZynAddSubFX. You'll have to set to a higher value and turn off automated background tasks (like virus scanners, email clients, etc.).
-    If you have more cards, you can select the desired card where you can play audio with the environment variable "PA_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE"
-    Eg: "set PA_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE=1"
-    A better way to set all of this, I will put on next versions.
-
-
-Please send me instruments,banks,master settings,songs(midi+...xmz files) done with ZynAddSubFX. I'll appreciate this.

-Have fun! :-)
